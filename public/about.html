    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Danial Wajhat, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of
      Science in Computer Science (BSCS) at Bahria University. As a dedicated
      student, I have maintained a commendable Cumulative Grade Point Average
      (CGPA) of 3.43, reflecting my commitment to academic excellence.

    <p>
      My academic journey at Bahria University has not only equipped me with a
      strong theoretical foundation in computer science but has also fostered my
      passion for development and artificial intelligence (AI). These two
      fields, in particular, captivate my interest due to their dynamic nature
      and potential to revolutionize various industries.

      Through my coursework and extracurricular activities, I have actively
      engaged in exploring the realms of software development, honing my skills
      in coding, debugging, and software design. Additionally, my fascination
      with AI has led me to delve into machine learning algorithms, neural
      networks, and data analysis techniques.
